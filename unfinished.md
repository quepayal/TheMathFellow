## Unfinished <a id="f8c2"></a>

Falling to and fro, in your head and soul,  
Somehow I find myself in this mindless attempt.  
Crossing star lines in the winter cold,  
Finding what is lost in the spring and fall.  
Neither I want to say anything to you,  
Nor do I want to explain.  
For what was lost in the light,  
It feels lost to me forever and long.  
Timeless pursuit of your passion,  
Drives the madness in the picture for me.  
With millions of unfinished pages left behind,  
I don’t really care about leaving this page of yours unfinished.
