## Endless Night by Agatha Christie — Review <a id="30c7"></a>

Every Night and every Morn  
Some to Misery are Born.  
Every Morn and every Night  
Some are Born to Sweet Delight.  
Some are Born to Sweet Delight,  
Some are Born to Endless Night.

— William Blake

Are you afraid of someone just because they might know you better than you know yourself?  
But then there’s always a choice. Would you trust yourself to make the right one?  
Can you be able to see what’s truly worthy, or you’ll just let ignorance take the fall and repent for Endless Nights?

If these questions interest you, then I bet you’ll love this psychological thriller by Agatha Christie. The novel has a dark and suspenseful plot, nevertheless, and it has the warmth of a Love story.

Michael Roger, the main protagonist, a chauffeur by profession, dreams of a better life with his love in a magnificent house. A splendid property, _The Tower_ interests him; it’s where he meets Ellie, an heiress, marrying who makes his dream come to reality. But little did he know that the place’s cursed and defying the endless warnings exact a higher price than he ever imagined.

_Endless Night_ is a divergence from Agatha’s Detective style; it’s not really a whodunnit. The time you’ll finish the novel, you’ll realize it was always more than … Umm, I won’t speak. Anyway, as the story progresses, _The Tower_ would play the instigator unearthing the dark conspiracy, some of what you never saw coming…

As Blake says, some are really born to _sweet delight_ despite what happens, while despite what one encompasses, they are born to _endless night_.

### Rating: 4.5 / 5 <a id="a702"></a>

Arigato!!
