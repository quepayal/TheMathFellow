> And believe that they would respect me and mine.  
> But today I’m curse to be born,  
> Through mother I’m chose to be torn.  
> Works assigned to me, role assigned to me.

> In my country evils surround me,  
> Danse macabre roams around me,  
> De facto it kicks at me.  
> It’s hell to be a girl in society like this,  
> Deo gratia help me to face those hungry wolves.  
> To chase them to their howling troops,  
> And here arrives…
