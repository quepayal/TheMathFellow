# Your Thought

Someday some evening when sky’s turning red,

## Your Thought <a id="e7b2"></a>

Someday some evening when the sky’s turning red,  
And orange sun fades into the horizon,  
I’ll still be thinking about you.

Like a wanderer in search of peace,  
Traveling through the winds,  
And the sand under my feet.

A spot I remember full of memories,  
And I absentmindedly stop to glance,  
Of what we were and what we could have been.
