## I thought we’d time… <a id="122c"></a>

I don’t know about you all, but personally, I’ve experienced this on multiple occasions. It’s this strange feeling I’ve always felt whenever a friend of mine or my loved one left me. By leaving, I don’t necessarily mean them being sent to heaven. It’s just as simple as friends being separated after spending 4 years of a good time in college or a colleague of yours whom you admire very much transferring to some other team or some other company.

Today something similar happened, and it taught me a great lesson…

It so happened that I’d a teammate, a perfect one. Both intellectually and on an emotional level. He was the first person I was introduced to when I first joined the company and was my primary source of answers to my stupidest questions. Over time I’d really come to admire his programming skills, and he was the one I was looking up to.

Our project was in acceleration mode, and we were re-engineering, and I had in my mind that we’ll collaborate and learn a great deal from him. He’d been since starting guiding me on things I should focus on and how I could approach certain problems and help me manage my anxiety… I still remember him telling me repeatedly, “Did you go through that codebase? If you’ve any questions, you can ask me; I’ll help you clarify your doubts.”

And guess my natural reaction. “Oh yeah, I’d been busy. I’ll probably see that later, And I’ll ask you…”

And today, when this news came up, I felt mixed emotions. I was delighted that he got this wonderful opportunity to join this wonderful team, but at the same time, I was feeling sad, despondent…

I kept wondering the whole evening, “What the heck is wrong with me?” Also, I’ve got this weird deja vu feeling that I’ve experienced before. There’s something strange about this feeling.

I asked my friend and my sister for help. And when they asked me enough questions regarding why I was feeling what I was feeling. Then, I understood the root cause of it.

> It was the guilt that I was feeling…

Deep down, no matter how many times I decline it, I know I had a regret. A regret that I didn’t make the maximum of time of what we had together. I didn’t learn enough from him. It makes me really sad thinking how much I could’ve learned from him and how much that collaboration might have helped me develop into an excellent Software Engineer. Only if I’d not thought that we’ve plenty of time…

Isn’t it a common scenario, where we take a human being for granted, we like to be around them, but rarely learn from them, the things that make them special, or even appreciate them until it’s time to finally go!

So I’d my lesson that I’ll forever keep in my mind. I’ll appreciate the people I’ve around me by embracing the uniqueness they bring to my life and by learning from them whatever they’ve to offer…

By the way, I asked him to be my Mentor :P…
