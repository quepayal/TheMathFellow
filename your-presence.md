# Your Presence

Hailstones have never hurt the landscape,

## Your Presence <a id="15a7"></a>

Hailstones have never hurt the landscape,  
But the landscape lets itself be colored in its essence.  
For soon sun will be out, brightly shining with cosmic energy,  
And soon all of it will be lost in transparent vapors,  
Just like your presence one day from this planetâ€¦
