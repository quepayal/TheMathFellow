I see how it goes for you,  
The Paris and bridge that day you knew,  
Faraway, Faraway,  
Out of reach, you go,  
Leaving me strangling, with the thought of us.

Standing there outside in the cold,  
Staring at the bridge as the Paris falls,  
Underneath, Underneath,  
In the ice, I go, with you on the mirror floor.

By the time you come town alone,  
As the night begins to fall,  
And I’m gone so far away, far away,  
Freezing cold as the breath lefts me alone,  
I wonder if I ever come across.

In your thoughts as I leave this earth…
