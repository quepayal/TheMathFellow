# Blank Space

It all starts with that tiny spark,

## Blank Space <a id="2f4e"></a>

It all starts with that tiny spark,  
That lights up my heavenly composure.  
From that little concern of yours,  
To the things you share.

I cherish them forever,  
For they make up the universe of memories for me.  
And things start to feel better,  
The mind starts to float in melody.

And the stars start twinkling,  
The wind starts blowing, and the smile spreads itself,  
On the surface of whom youâ€™re the only existence known to love \_\_.
