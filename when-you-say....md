# When you say…

You believe in the sunrise, Even when the sun sets in the west. You see the empty blue sky, And stars at night without being perplexed…

## When you say… <a id="e8ea"></a>

You believe in the sunrise,  
Even when the sun sets in the west.  
You see the empty blue sky,  
And stars at night without being perplexed.

You sip the ocean down your throat,  
Not realizing the aquatic life touched its soul.  
You see the love in dark blue eyes,  
Yet unaffected by tears of wandering strangers.

You believe your relative truth,  
Hidden in the veil of your lost lies.  
You feel the cold wind showering stardust,  
And the warmth of the sun on the same skin.

You change clothes with seasons,  
Like you change your perspective in little decisions.  
You grieve for one entity,  
While wondering at the cry in another scene.

You trade otherworldly things for the time,  
Aren’t you always lying?

You are a simulation of a world,  
When you say you’re a human being.

> Tribute to my Dog. I loved him very dearly and will always remember him!
