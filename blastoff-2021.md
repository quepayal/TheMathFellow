> Hey there, it’s already the year 2021! And my aspirations are no less than that of Jack Sparrow from Pirates of Caribbean!

_This blog will share my learnings regarding my last year’s resolutions and present my New Year’s Resolutions — Edition 2021. So let’s dive into it._

## Learnings 2020 <a id="8e19"></a>

My last year’s resolutions comprised of the following —

### Running 2K in the morning every day. <a id="1341"></a>

**\[0.75/1\] Rating**

**Running 2K every morning** did not succeed straight away. For the first week, I was running on sheer will and motivation fireblast, but it didn’t last long, and the day I skipped running turned into months, and I wondered why the heck did I choose this as my resolution? And it’s not a great feeling.

**Two things I figured out that I missed during my goal setting —**

**First**, I didn’t run with the athlete mindset and solely depended on my will to complete the run. And you know the thing with motivation, sometimes you have it, other times they’re like lost friends, and you stay in bed and cheers in their memories. Cheers!

> **Takeaway point** — Just remove that damn motivation from your life picture and embrace the grinding and rigor of discipline and build the habit.

**Second**, I didn’t have a backup plan and assumed everything would happen according to me. I didn’t interpret before that I can be greeted by heavy smoke pollution in the morning or that the shoes I had were not suitable for running, and instead, I was hurting myself.

It took time to realize these things and create a mindset to keep the commitments I made to myself and reinforce this particular habit without exceptions. I also came up with an alternate strategy to get things done. And of course, I love my brand new Adidas Nova Flow!

Not to mention the **Nike Run+ app,** which's a wonderful way to capture the moments as you achieve them. As they say, Give a pat to yourself. You deserve this moment!

### Reading Fiction / Non -Fiction weekly. <a id="a84b"></a>

**\[0.5/1\] Rating**

**Reading** is my thing, and I’m in love with it. But I’m mostly into fiction, and I didn’t realize it until a friend of mine pointed that out. So it was easy to get through the fiction but kind of a struggle to go through non-fiction. I used to miss the connection and mystery I had with fiction books, which non-fiction subtly lacked. Until I noticed how wrong I was, and the real culprit behind my short span focus was my divided attention!

> **Takeaway point** — Your intensity of short span focus that makes it difficult to get through a book is proportional to your excessive dopamine addiction to social media.

_**Why I rated it low?**_

It’s because I didn’t read enough, and the Non-Fiction books I started are not completed yet. The biggest mistake I made was not curating _**the list of books I target to read that year**_. What used to happen is that I would pick up a book and read a bit, and out of the blue, I come to know about another book, and I literally ditched and suspended the current book for an infinite time.

From now on, I’ve curated a great list of Non-Fiction and Fiction books I target to read this year on **Goodreads** and have even booked the time daily to ensure I read enough. And I’ve done a great job of keeping myself away from social media.

### Learn ML and practice on Kaggle. <a id="09e4"></a>

**\[0.25/1\] Rating**

This went terribly than what I anticipated.

_**What went wrong?**_

Honestly, I didn’t properly schedule it in the day, and it slipped quite unnoticing. Also, putting it straightly, I didn’t felt like doing it anyway. My attitude was like enjoying the typical lockdown and sleeping all day long. Naturally, I’m ashamed of it.

But what I noticed was that there were other factors too —

**First**, I went straight for the head, just like Thanos asked in Avengers — Infinity war. And if you’re not Thor with that big hammer, you’re going to taste the dust. That’s exactly what happened. I was running to advanced topics without building foundations and practice, and as you can see, it didn’t turn out well.

**Second**, I made the mistake of just relying on online study materials without any physical book. So my routine was 9–6 p.m. work, and my eyes were literally sore thereafter. It’s hard to find the energy to study things online with constant interruptions from work and stressed eyes. Don’t forget about eventually drifting to social media and going into the comparison rabbit hole. It’s such a vicious cycle, and I often get lost in it.

From now on, I’ve bought my lovely mathematics-centered Machine learning book, and I’m going to shut the laptop at 6 p.m. sharp and invest in my study because more than anyone else, I need my time more.

### Avoid social media and distractions. Instead, write on Medium. <a id="e2b9"></a>

**\[0.75/1\] Rating**

I think I did a fairly good job in distancing myself from social media, and it’s toxic. Most of the credit I’ll give to my work as SDE. I always have tons of stuff to learn and implement to keep me away from my phone.

The initial difficulty in leaving social media was regarding a medium to share and receive information. I noticed that I wasn’t sharing with the right audience, and the existing information available was next to trash for me.

This was the time I discovered **Medium**, and I fell in love with it. Medium is the perfect platform I ever wanted, and I’m so thankful to them.

Now writing has become a thing to me!

### Do a great job at my current role as SDE at Microsoft. <a id="0533"></a>
