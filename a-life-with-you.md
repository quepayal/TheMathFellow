## A life with you <a id="941f"></a>

I still remember that day,  
With the sky above,  
And my face under the hat,  
The feelings that felt so strange,  
And the mountains that echoed my sobs.

The desire to become strong,  
The ambition to protect the ones I loved,  
The prayer to never have to live this nightmare again,  
To never feel so lonely,  
And living dead with their memories.

You came like a storm,  
And landed the punch right on my hat,  
Told me to stop crying,  
Looked me straight in the eye,  
I swear I believed you to this day.

**When you said you won’t die.**

You said you’re way stronger,  
And that you’d never leave a weakling like me,  
Alone in this world,  
Then why did you had to go,  
And leave me broken as before.

Can you see me from the place you’re,  
The aghast face of your adored brother,  
The horror in these eyes,  
The screams calling your name,  
And still the uncanny silence in my mind.

Come back, won’t you?
