# Lost in You

Ain’t it so beautiful, to be lost in the sky that’s lost in it’s vastness,

## Lost in You <a id="44c0"></a>

Ain’t it so beautiful, to be lost in the sky that’s lost in its vastness,  
To stare at the clouds that make up every bit of themselves only to rain down.

The tiny drops that sit on top of that rose,  
That eventually slides down to be lost in the earth,  
Ain’t it so weird that in spite of all things I could get lost in.

I choose to get lost in your thought…
