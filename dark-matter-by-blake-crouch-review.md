> ― **Blake Crouch, Dark Matter**

There are times when we think about what would have happened if you had made a choice otherwise… Would life had been more promising? But what about the sacrifices you’ll need to make it happen? Will they never tempt you into thinking what life would have been with them… These are the questions we may never know. Every time you decide, it’s once and for all indefinite in its consequences in some or other way.

**Blake’s** new book **Dark Matter** is a science fiction thriller. It’s about a Physics Professor Jason Desson, who is knocked unconscious by a masked abductor one night. If you ask me about Jason, he had no potential enemy… Then who could try to hurt him? Jason had a wonderful wife, a teenage son, a satisfactory if not a very promising job. Of course, later we discover in the story, had he sacrificed his love affair, he’d been more successful.

The twist in the story happens when drugged Jason wakes up in the City of Chicago or, better not, _his_ City of Chicago. There’s something subtly wrong with everything, like in microscopic details. Is he hallucinating? And countless, relentless questions??? But hey hey hey, here we are in the world of Jason the Physicist, not the normal one, Oh mind me, they aren’t anyway normal! Rather the revolutionary scientific superstar working on a zillion-dollar secret project to alter space and time Jason, but how can it be??? As many of you’ll guess here, we’re talking of different dimensions of reality. We’re in the realm of quantum superposition, invented by our friend Jason. Tons of clap! XD

And yeah, our Jason is trapped, someone that looks like him in every microscopic detail except the Road not taken, and it has made all the difference one difference… So this alternate bastard thinks and literally executes his plan of stealing the life of our poor Jason! How pathetic, ain’t it?

Times running out, and so are their lifelines. He must find out his one in a zillion reality from the infinite realms.

Blake’s book is really thrilling to the root, with scenes blooming with immense imagination. Of course, the physics isn’t accurate, but the great effort on his part. The ending wasn’t very satisfactory to me. It could’ve been more improvised.

But honestly, it’s a book I gulped in a day…

## Rating : 4/ 5 <a id="a0d2"></a>

Arigato!!
