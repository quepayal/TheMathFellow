# Moon’s Promise

It’s eclipse,

## Moon’s Promise <a id="f210"></a>

It’s an eclipse,  
The crescent moon glistening.  
Though it’s unnaturally dark,  
There’s a faint light radiating.

A soul staring at her own reflection,  
Inundated in cold showers, devoid of light.  
Though the lightning blazes,  
The sound’s impotent to wake her spirit.

The fairy lights and stardust starts to sprinkle over her,  
Her wet eyes search for its source.  
The moon who’s glancing her since dawn,  
Swiftly hide behind the dark cloud.

‘Why you’re lavishing this beauty of yours on me?’ — she asks.  
‘Because I can’t see you cry unlike him,  
Who sleeps knowing you’ll still be awake’ — the moon blushes.  
‘I don’t know about others but even in dawn I’ll shine for you,  
Just imagine me in your heart, and I’ll be there for you.’

The eyes moister than ever cry in happiness.  
For there’s this someone who loves her in every sense…
