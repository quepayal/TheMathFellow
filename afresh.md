## Afresh <a id="371a"></a>

Wither and cold, light unfolds,  
Do you see me staring at your face?  
The late hour on the ocean floor,  
Do you hear anything except the waves?  
Stolen star shooting afar,  
Can you feel them whispering promises in your head?  
Forgotten thoughts like the Dandelion of yours,  
Do you remember blowing them with me in the wind?

Feelings afresh, strange that it spikes the pain in my heart that you left ajar.
