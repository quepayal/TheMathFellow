## Thinkin’ <a id="e172"></a>

I never thought that it’d fall apart,  
And never ever come back to me.  
When I sleep in the night under the cold starry sky,  
I’d let it dawn on me that you’re no more there for me.

Thinkin’ of the past that flows like the sand,  
I try to hold it in my hand.  
But I loose in this attempt,  
And then your spirit lifts me up once again.

It feels like a new morning,  
When you kiss me on cheeks in the form of sun kiss.  
It reminds me of those times,  
When you’d drag me around on your back.

When you were still around me…
