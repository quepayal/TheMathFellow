# Fall

Fire in the eyes, fire in the thoughts, This forest of memories, just let it all go. Thinkin’ of future, it mixes it all, You reach for one…

## Fall <a id="1f68"></a>

Fire in the eyes, fire in the thoughts,  
This forest of memories, just let it all go.  
Thinkin’ of future, it mixes it all,  
You reach for one and forget the other.

Those purple gradients, now they’re gone,  
Fill in the darkness, and sink in the core.  
You say my name, amidst the springs,  
And the fall screams from the east.
