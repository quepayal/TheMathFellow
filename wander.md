# Wander

The knot that tied me to you, Will never ever untangle, When the sun will start to startle, The moon will glisten in its presence.

## Wander <a id="7c6f"></a>

The knot that tied me to you,  
Will never ever untangle,  
When the sun will start to startle,  
The moon will glisten in its presence.

As you start to unravel the flowers,  
Hidden amongst in the soft fragrance,  
Is my endless love waiting for you,  
That’ll never fade away, unlike the scent.

In the sky full of wonders,  
Wondering how many of them really matter,  
Painted like the rose in the sky,  
That’s filled with the blues of the seasons.

Thinkin’ of the stars across the lines,  
Forgetting the self-drawn matt lines,  
With my hair full of your textures,  
Let me wander in your forest until the sunrise.
