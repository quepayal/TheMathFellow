## Overwhelmed <a id="ba5d"></a>

Like walking on the sand with no ceilings around me,  
I see my shadows turning black from the colors that surround me.  
The fall of the feathers that kept me warm all these mornings,  
I feel the shiver in my veins as I watch it fall.

Is it the end of all the world that watched me grow,  
Is the ocean turning red with all these feelings around me?  
I miss the essence of the fresh breath that held me,  
In the sky of my world, how did thunder strike it?

You don’t have to know, even if you understand it,  
What the havoc this time has on me…
