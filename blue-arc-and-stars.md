# Blue Arc and Stars

Have you been near chaos when it felt unusually quiet?

## Blue Arc and Stars <a id="a32f"></a>

Have you been near chaos when it felt unusually quiet?  
When the rain chatters but the window sill is so unmoved,  
And so everything becomes so hazy,  
And the sky dark, and darker with shivering colossal clouds…  
Yet I sit in my room, with frames of time hanging on the wall,  
I dare not see them, for it might delude me…  
So I close my eyes,  
With the blue arc around my ears, it has the feel of you,  
And the glimpse of that night moon…  
With warm light spread into my chaotic world,  
The stars and vibrant colors are what I most aspire for,  
Maybe the night seems lost,

But with those memories, I’m good as Oblivion…
