## Am I an unknown thought to you? <a id="7e3c"></a>

Are you dying in your imagination?  
In the midst of the tranquility of my presence.  
With one pair of feather and other to wither,  
Your mind might be phoenix tonight,  
When I look at you with my violet eyes.

The soul that runs deep through you,  
Is the one I left behind.  
In the millennials to come,  
The thought would sabotage itself,  
And you’ll be free from your imagination in the realm of my consciousness…
