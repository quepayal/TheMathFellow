# Silver

Standing in front of the mirror, And it's shining. Trace out all the silvers, And they’re all fading. Smiling and shying all this time…

## Silver <a id="74c4"></a>

Standing in front of the mirror,  
And it's shining.  
Trace out all the silvers,  
And they’re all fading.  
Smiling and shying all this time,  
And I get so lost in your light.  
Amber on the floor,  
With different strokes of your love.  
Frozen in the fractals,  
Still, I’m aspiring.

### Afterthoughts <a id="b953"></a>

This poem is from the perspective of a girl who loves a boy who’s personified by the mirror. When he’s before her, it’s like a reflection of herself, and he’s beautiful to her in every sense. Over time they’ve made several connections that are like silver wires, and when she began to trace them out, the time has come, and they’re slowly fading away. The journey with him had been wonderful and had always brought a smile on her face and sometimes made her shy. She always gets so lost in him, and time feels like an eternity.

So she decided to confess to him even though they’d never meet again, but she’d still like him to know that she loved him. The boy smiles and tells her they can be friends, and the virtual rose fallen is compared to amber on the floor. Strokes of colors have depicted the boy’s love, they’d always bring a smile to her face, and today it brought tears.

Frozen as in fractals is her heart, but she still loves him forever, and the love always aspires. Maybe someday she’ll meet him.
