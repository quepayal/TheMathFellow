## The Fault in Our Stars by John Green — Review <a id="d7e7"></a>

“The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves, that we are underlings.” — Act 1, Scene 2 of [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare)’s play [_Julius Caesar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_%28play%29)_._

These quotes suggest that nothing but ourselves is to blame for the world’s evil nature.

The fault in our stars by John Green talks about the polar opposite. It’s like, sometimes _The fault is in our stars…_ When the world crashes down, and you never wanted it to. It’s about those times when no one but fate is to blame. But even in those dark times, the stars of happiness twinkles and leaves you mesmerized.

The novel is narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old girl with thyroid cancer that has affected her lungs, by which I mean her lungs sucks at being lungs. My first impression on reading the intro got me thinking that novel might be somewhat sad and depressing but trust me, it’s a hell of a lot of adventure, funny and beautiful in a subtle way, that even in the loss, the tears are of happiness.

The book starts with Hazel’s family forcing her to attend a support group to make her feel better, where she subsequently meets 17-year-old Augustus Waters \(Gus\), an ex-basketball player amputee.

Eventually, as you all would guess, they fall in love, and honestly, you’ll love Gus. Gus is what I’ll say, the one with the charm and those beautiful vibes you can’t help falling for! I mean, he’s a guy who put the cigarette in his mouth but doesn’t light it, so it’s a metaphor that he put the killing thing inside his mouth but doesn’t give it the power to kill. His optimism towards life inspires the interests in Hazel that her life can be beautiful…

The novel progresses with Gus interleaving well in the life of Hazel. They both share moments of happiness and grief. There are certain instances in the book where you can’t just hold your tears, but as I said before, they still smell of Happiness.

The best part of the novel is their _Little Infinity_ that some infinities are bigger than other infinities. You see, even in her limited timeline, she fell in love forever, and as Keats says — “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”

The story progresses with Gus and Hazel visiting Amsterdam to meet the author of their favorite book, _An Imperial Affliction._ This is what I’ll say spring and autumn part of their relationship. You’ll make sense of what I mean when you read…

The book is one of my personal favorites, it’s the one like the wind, and you can’t help flowing with it and yet afraid that it’ll drop you soon in tears…

I hope you enjoy reading it. Moreover, the movie is also awesome!
