## Ending Scene <a id="adcc"></a>

Life went good, so far, so deep,  
And I got used to you, and I mean,  
The flowers you brought are sinking deep,  
As I go down now and I can’t feel.

This thunder that ruined you,  
Your afterthought ruined me,  
And there goes our life down a cliff,  
And there goes our love so deep, so steep.

You never wonder why, the amber leaves,  
To swim across the Nile like in a dutch sea,  
To sail on the tide on the highest peak,  
But now you lay like an ending scene.
