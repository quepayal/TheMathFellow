# Itachi’s last thoughts…

And I never knew whose side I was…

## Itachi’s last thoughts… <a id="7510"></a>

And I never knew whose side I was,  
Life’s pretty easy for you to say,  
“You must have done that!”  
But only if you had my eyes,  
Only if you could see what I was seeing,  
Only if you knew what I was feeling…

I’ve experienced the war and bloodshed,  
Humanity killing each other without any thought,  
Of which I was a soul searching peace.  
No one should have experienced that,  
The pain, the lives lost, the massacre,  
It’s all darkness and the screams haunt me.

Why should I live then,  
I saw the cliff calling me,  
Maybe for me, there’s no meaning in life,  
Let me feel what dying feels like in eternity.

But what do I feel this,  
My younger brother I see,  
I can’t die like this, I’ve to protect him.  
And so my pursuit of peace began,  
By doing the lesser of the evil,  
The least path of the mass massacre for peace for everyone.

I chose the path of darkness and shadows,  
To take all the hatred and every evil thing upon myself,  
In hope that it’ll avoid the war, I once witnessed,  
I loved my younger brother more than he ever knew,  
But I’ll never tell him,  
I’ll die by his hands and that’s my repentance.

Maybe one day we reincarnate once again,  
And I’ll give him the love he deserved more than anyone else.  
And I’ll smile every day, every moment…  
I wonder if I’d instead looked into my dear brother's eyes,  
I wonder if I’d have trusted him,  
It might have made all the difference…

I wonder, being a prodigy was a curse instead??  
I wonder if I ever made life beautiful for someone,  
I wonder if people would ever love me,  
I wonder what love’s like,

Maybe Sasuke would someday teach me…
