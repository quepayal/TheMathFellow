## Long time ago <a id="9569"></a>

Silent is the sky tonight,  
Shooting comets with the promises on the flight,  
Strange is your visit tonight,  
After a year of being unusually quiet.

Ignorance had come quite naturally to the self,  
Wondering what else changed the wind,  
For it flows quite the opposite nowadays,  
Where shall you try to speak and I decided to dodge.

The truth is I can’t express it in transparent words,  
For there are too many eyes that scroll,  
The message that presents itself as a mere laugh,  
You don’t know what it engulfs.

Still strange your visit and unusual appearances,  
For they didn’t have a chance in millions to happen,  
Yet when they pass, my heart can be seen aching,  
After all, one can’t force the poor thing to sync.

After it’s been shattered.  
So this vengeance shall pursue you,  
Despite your sincere effort,  
For the fruit shall bore that you once planted.
