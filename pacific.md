# Pacific

My open arms are like the vastness of sky,

## Pacific <a id="cd18"></a>

My open arms are like the vastness of sky,  
And the depth of the blue pacific with Northern lights,  
And the wind that swirl my hairs wipes my mind clear.  
I see the ocean meet the sky,  
And the mountain they together build so high.  
The aroma that fills my soul,  
Makes me feel loved in dimensions I often get lostâ€¦
