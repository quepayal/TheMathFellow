# Fractal

Maybe someday you’ll know why I went quiet,

## Fractal <a id="8009"></a>

Maybe someday you’ll know why I went quiet,  
Maybe you’ll know why I don’t bug you anymore…  
It’s not that I’ve grown cold like a drop of water left in the backyard to freeze,  
It’s like I’ve become a fractal that might prick you if you touch,  
So all that you made me, I just wanna remember the touch of your skin,  
When you lifted me…  
The destination was unknown, so the sky always felt so full of colors,  
But now it’s just darkness, now that I’m gone, I know you won’t miss,

But I’ll always think about why you left me in the dark…
