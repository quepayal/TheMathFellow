## In the End <a id="1acf"></a>

The voice blowing inside my head,  
And here I am, escaping frozen window sills.  
Waiting for your wind to make me feel again,  
Though that never happened in the end.

I stay in the shades,  
Hoping sunshine to reach me here.  
When I’m closed to the world,  
You reveal like an oyster.

Waiting to be heard in the sound of the shores again,  
I stay late, hoping you find me in the end.  
Reflection of the clouds through my transparent eyes,  
They see lies in your every sentence.

One day when I go away,  
Cut those strings in the end.
