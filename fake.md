Thinking I can be someone,  
Who carries the weights like there isn’t,  
Like a white page,  
Invisible with colors,  
Living life that of the young blood.  
Pursuing light with frozen thoughts,  
Falling to ocean bed like it’s on earth,  
Staring at the sun that feels so cold,  
Wondering if it’s the sun at all?
