# Never Diminishing

Love is the way you breathe…

## Never Diminishing <a id="fca9"></a>

Love is the way you breathe,  
And it never felt the same since that spring.  
For all you were, and that mist of your love,  
Has never left me since.  
Those kind words of yours to me,  
That you unknowingly said.

And I can’t tell exactly when I felt for you that day,  
I pretend I don’t, and went to move on.  
And never expressed you the way…  
But the things have the way,  
And Universe wanted me to say.  
So the wind took me to you,  
To tell the truth, that I held every day.

I know if I tell, it never will be the same,  
But I loved you so much, to let you go if you wanted that way.  
So I tell you that day and it’s always the same,

With you in my thoughts and that smile of yours.  
You’re my other side of the world, my Never Diminishing Love…
