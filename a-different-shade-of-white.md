# A different shade of white

It was a cloudy day…

## A different shade of white <a id="7bad"></a>

It was a cloudy day, though it’s common for the sun to shine with all its might, clouds make the sky more artistic, yeah that’s the word I’ll use. Now and then, I’ll see them either drifting away or towards each other. In winters, I could’ve sucked them in a vacuum for getting in my sunshine’s way. But in summers, I’ll love to have them. They bring with themselves the promise of rain, the hope of rejuvenation…

So here was I, observing some of them, they seem pretty shapeless, right?! Yet I’ll see something in them. Each one of them is a different shade of black and white. So bizarre, it almost feels like polar opposite friends, but still FRIENDS…

So I thought of this silly analogy, that black cloud is my friend, all raged, ready to blow things up, full of lightning and thunder, from some strange Skyland, some descendent of Thor… And here’s me, a white cloud, completely clueless as to why my friend’s in such a state. Did something went wrong??

So now and then, he’ll brush against me trying to evoke a fight, but here I’m, in an unfuckwithable state, and he doesn’t know… He goes ranting, roaring, lightning, thunder, in super Thor Rage mode, and I’ll pretend not to hear and watch the sun above me. I can see the sun rays passing through me, it feels so radiating, so warm, I wonder does my friend feels this warmth in his cold body…And I feel sorry for him…

After some time, it happens, all his frustration and rage slowly fades and wash away with the rain, the gloomy rain\(how ironical, above I was saying promising, but everything’s different from a different perspective\), All that anger, the frustration he was carrying, just rains down in the form of tears…Now I see he’s also white, some shade of white.

> Come to think of it, there are times it’s wrong to judge someone, they might be heavy with condensed gloomy rain droplets, waiting to find their way out some or other way. Do give time, hopefully they’ll be better soon, soon they’ll be radiating some shade of white along with you…

Thanks for reading.
