# Weather

Red silk and your amber touch, Clouds my eyes in water like shape, When the petals fall from the sky.

## Weather <a id="1ba0"></a>

Red silk and your amber touch,  
Clouds my eyes in water like shape,  
When the petals fall from the sky.

The moon sometimes trick me into thinking,  
You’re somewhere still around,  
When you’re just thought in and out.

Arching over me and smiling,  
While the mist enters our space,  
That’s when I know you’re around.

It’s like your voice is reaching,  
But they’re instead hurting,  
So come back around when you feel like I’m here.

Lost in the void, Lost in your weather.
