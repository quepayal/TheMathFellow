Once, someone asked me what kind of friend do you prefer to have. I told them — _One that feels like a friend and a stranger at the same time._

There was a childhood instance in my life that shaped me like this. I was in 4th standard back then. I had a best friend, at least that’s what I believed back in those days. I wanted them to spend all their time and attention with me. Then came a day that opened my eyes from this daydream. They weren’t so faithful as I was to them, and I’ve met a lot like them to spot them from a distance. That day something terrible happened to me, and everyone accused me of something I didn’t do. They realized their mistake in the latter part of the day, but they did enough damage to me, and I was done for this crap.

My tears weren’t stopping that day, and those best friends of mine left me for good. And I was alone to reflect on all this. That day my teacher approached me and asked what I’m thinking. After hearing my story, she said just one line, and it stuck with me forever.

Honestly, I was done with this friendship thing, and since then, I didn’t beg for the friendship again. If we vibe, then we vibe. A friend to enjoy our time together with and a stranger to not expect anything.

Best relationships are made when we don’t expect anything. And if you ask anyone about me, then they’ll say, I’m a good friend but a stranger in a strange sense as well.

I might be sounding narcissistic right now. I apologize, but here it is anyway.
