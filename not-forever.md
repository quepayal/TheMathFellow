# Not forever

The castle threw you away, In the wild with unknown, The cries died away, Like the jewels from your clothes.

## Not forever <a id="839b"></a>

The castle threw you away,  
In the wild with the unknown,  
The cries died away,  
Like the jewels from your clothes.

The once soft fur,  
Is the battleground of your struggles,  
And the face you don’t remember,  
You search it in all who comes.

Love is all I can offer you,  
But that too is transient,  
For I’m not here for long,  
To better fade in the stars above.

Though your eyes make me sad,  
When you call for someone,  
I come around,  
And you revolve around me like I’m the sun to shine.  
Know I might shine,  
But soon I’ll be out and you’ll be left in darkness but not forever my love…
