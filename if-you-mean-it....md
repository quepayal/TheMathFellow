## If you mean it… <a id="f8bd"></a>

Don’t know why I feel like I’m hiding,  
From the fiction and all of its attractions.  
They say feel the love and go and live it,  
And I can’t say anymore I’m tired of it.

The season changes it all, the autumn and the fall,  
And I long to live that day when it was springtime.  
Sunshine and shore, Can you hear them talk,  
Come and dance with us tonight.

Can you feel the love when you say it,  
Make me feel it all if you mean it.  
Mist till the dusk, and then it's raining,  
Cold as it goes so don’t say it.

Only make me fall if you mean it…
