When the chaos finally settles in mind, we often visit some of our cherishing and thoughtful moments.

I reminisce about an incident during my summer vacation, back when I was 10. So one early morning, I saw my mother plucking roses for offering during morning prayers. It was springtime, and our garden was blooming with roses and blossom buds. It’s such an aromatic memory…

I helped her pluck some of them and followed her inside our house. Then what I saw surprised the childhood me. She put the roses into a large transparent glass bowl of water. Now they were floating like the clouds in the sky, but only they were more vibrant than later.

I curiously asked her, “Why do you put the rose in water, Mom?” to which she answered, “Rose needs water to live, my Lil’ child! If you don’t, then they’ll die and shrivel to disintegrated petals…” I exclaimed, “That’s bad, I really love them, they smell so beautiful, so pure… I don’t want them to die.”

Thereafter the scientist in me started experimenting. I googled up about the osmosis stuff and came to know that rose needs nutrients to survive. I then took three roses still in partial bud form and put them in plain water, sugar solution, and the salt solution. And then I waited for the day; occasionally, I would check them in brief intervals. Then to my surprise, they bloomed just as mother told. It was such a mesmerizing scene; despite being plucked from its stem, it still lives and blooms! So awesome…

But to my dismay, when I saw them again in the morning, they no longer had their same enchanted charm, they were dead, or I suddenly realized they were long dead since the moment I plucked them! The water was just a simulation of an artificial environment that made them believe that they were living and full of vitality. But the truth soon dawned upon me and on the lives of those innocent roses…

> Sometimes we let others pluck our dreams like this. We pretend to live in their perfect version of artificially simulated environment. At first it may seem to be working just fine but in reality it’s slowly killing you, until you’re finally dead. No matter what others might bring to heal you, you simply won’t make it unless it’s your own chosen path, your own stem of curiosity…
