# Promise

The way you can’t say enough, Even when you say the words, They cut through my mind, Amongst your presence, With false essence.

## Promise <a id="83c4"></a>

The way you can’t say enough,  
Even when you say the words,  
They cut through my mind,  
Amongst your presence,  
With false essence.

Howcome your beautiful eyes,  
It turned into savage tonight,  
You don’t seem you after all,  
Since that day long in the past,  
The way when you wrapped up that scarf.

You said you'd wrap it around me,  
Countless times in the future to feel,  
And now you say you despise me,  
Since childhood, now and ever to be,  
I know this is all but a blatant lie to me.

With whatever you say and do,  
You’ll always find me beside you.
