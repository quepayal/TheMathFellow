Trade-Off","keywords":"","body":"Intuition and Mathematical Proof of The Bias-Variance Trade-Off\nAssessing the model’s accuracy is one of the most crucial things while determining the model that’s best suited for a particular dataset and a problem. By which I mean we need to determine how close the predictions made are to the actual observed values.\nTerminology\nIn general, for a particular problem, for an observed quantitative response  Y  and  p  different predictors/features, we define the relationship between  Y  and Vector  X  :\n Y = f(X) + \\epsilon \nAccordingly, regarding estimation,  \\hat f  represents our estimation for  f  that on a set of Predictors  X  yields  \\hat Y  that represents the resulting prediction for  Y .\n \\hat Y = \\hat f(X) \n f(x)  is some fixed but unknown function of the Vector  X . Generally,  Y  has a non-deterministic relationship. It is also a function of  \\epsilon  which cannot be predicted using  X  and, in the term, is the irreducible error. Think about  \\epsilon  as some low impact or unmeasurable feature, which is essentially a random error term. It’s synonymous with Gaussian noise, henceforth has zero mean. That is,\n {\\mathbb{E}} [\\epsilon] = 0, var(\\epsilon) = \\sigma_\\epsilon^2 = {\\mathbb{E}} [\\epsilon^2] - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\epsilon]^2 = {\\mathbb{E}} [\\epsilon^2] \nIn regression settings, we examine the loss using the Squared Loss function for one of the instances: the square of the difference between the actual observed value and the Predicted value.\nAveraging the Squared Loss per instance over the whole dataset gives us the Mean Squared Error (MSE). That is,\n MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat f(x_i))^2 = {\\mathbb{E}} [(y - \\hat f(x))^2] \nBias refers to the error that is inherently introduced by simplifying the assumptions used in the model for better interpretability at the cost of flexibility for the otherwise highly complicated real-life problem. It’s defined as the difference between the Expected value of Prediction  \\hat f(x)  to the Actual Observed value  f(x)  for a given unseen test data point. That is,\n bias[\\hat f(x)] = {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] - f(x) \nVariance represents the quantitative amount by which a random variable differs from its expected value. When we change the training dataset for a highly flexible model, then because of overfitting, the estimated Prediction function  \\hat f(x)  changes drastically. Whereas for learning algorithms like linear regression, logistics regression, the variance is quite low. And also,  \\hat f(x)  is essentially estimated over a particular training dataset. Hence different training data would result in different  \\hat f(x) . Over the range of different training datasets, the Expected squared deviation of  \\hat f(x)  from its expected value  {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)]  is the Variance. That is,\n var(\\hat f(x)) = {\\mathbb{E}} [(\\hat f(x) - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)])^2] \nThis brings us to the infamous Bias-Variance trade-off resulting from two competing properties of Statistical Learning methods. Accordingly, as evident by the equation to the Expected Test MSE for a given data point  x , comprises of the variance of  \\hat f(x) , the squared bias of  \\hat f(x) , and the variance of the error term  \\epsilon . That is,\n {\\mathbb{E}} [(y - \\hat f(x))^2] = var(\\hat f(x)) + [bias[\\hat f(x)]]^2 + var(\\epsilon) \nThis equation tells that to minimize the Expected Test MSE, and we need a statistical method that simultaneously achieves low variance and low bias. Also, as the variance is an inherently nonnegative quantity, and squared bias is also nonnegative. Hence Expected Test MSE would always stay above  Var(\\epsilon) .\nMathematical Proof\nExpected Prediction Error,  {\\mathbb{E}} [(y - \\hat f(x))^2]  of a regression fit  \\hat f(x)  at input data point  X = x  using MSE is —\n \n    \\begin{equation} \\label{eq1}\n        \\begin{split}\n            MSE & = {\\mathbb{E}} [(y - \\hat f(x))^2 | X = x] \\\\\n                & = {\\mathbb{E}} [(y - \\hat f(x))^2] = {\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) + \\epsilon - \\hat f(x))^2] \\\\\n                & = {\\mathbb{E} [(f(x) - \\hat f(x))^2] + {\\mathbb{E}} [\\epsilon^2]} + 2{\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) - \\hat f(x)) \\epsilon] \\\\\n                & = {\\mathbb{E} [(f(x) - \\hat f(x))^2] + {\\mathbb{E}} [\\epsilon^2]} + 2{\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) - \\hat f(x))] {\\mathbb{E}} [\\epsilon] \\\\\n                & = {\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) - \\hat f(x))^2] + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2 \\\\\n        \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation}\n\nTaken from Alecos Papadopoulos StackExchange\nRecall that  \\hat f(x)  is the predictor function we have constructed based on m data points.  (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), …, (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)}) .\nOn the other hand,  Y  is the prediction we are making on a new data point using the model constructed on the m data points above.\n (x^{(m+1)}, y^{(m+1)}) .\nThe assumptions that we have for the new data point is that —\n\nIt was not used while constructing  \\hat f(x) \nIt is independent of all the previous training data points\nAnd it's independent of  \\epsilon^{m+1} .\n\nHence we can conclude that  \\hat f(x)  and  \\epsilon  are independent random variables.\nFurther expanding  {\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) - \\hat f(x))^2]  term.\n \n    \\begin{equation} \\label{eq2}\n        \\begin{split}\n            {\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) - \\hat f(x))^2] \n            & = {\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) + {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] - \\hat f(x))^2] \\\\\n            & = {\\mathbb{E}} [({\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] - f(x))^2] + {\\mathbb{E}} [(\\hat f(x) - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)])^2] - 2 {\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)])] (\\hat f(x) - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)]) \\\\\n            & = \\underbrace{ \n                ({\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] - f(x))^2}_\\text{bias[f^(x)]} + \\underbrace{\n                {\\mathbb{E}} [(\\hat f(x) - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)])]^2}_\\text{variance[f^(x)]} - 2 {\\mathbb{E}} [(f(x) - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)])] ({\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] - {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)]) \\\\\n            & = bias[\\hat f(x)] + variance[\\hat f(x)] \\\\\n        \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation}\n\n {\\mathbb{E}}[\\hat f(x)]  and  f(x)  both are constant. Hence there difference that is,  Bias {\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] − f(x)  is just a constant. Therefore, applying expectation to squared bias,  ({\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] − f(x))^2  does not have any effect.\nHence,  {\\mathbb{E}} [({\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] - f(x))^2] = ({\\mathbb{E}} [\\hat f(x)] - f(x))^2 \nTherefore combining the above three equations we get,\n {\\mathbb{E}}[(y - \\hat f(x))^2] = var(\\hat f(x)) + [bias(\\hat f(x))]^2 + var(\\epsilon) \nThis is actually an interesting equation, and to find an appropriate model for our dataset, we’ve to strike a balance between those two competing properties — Bias and Variance.\nReferences\n\nStackExchange\n\nTowards Data Science\n\nStatLearning\n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); "}}}
