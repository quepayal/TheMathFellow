# Aurora

Maybe thy know what I mean, To sleep in the space full of him…

## Aurora <a id="f1b9"></a>

\`Where do thy beautiful wings take away\` — The wind asks.  
\`Anywhere in the Cosmos…\` — She said.  
\`Then why thou sleep in the Ocean always,  
Why not in the vast land with Enchanting Lights, Oh Aurora!\`

\`Oh, wind thou live up in the Sky,  
Unaware of the secrets how deep they lie.  
Maybe you can measure the vastness of the Sky,  
But the depth of the Ocean … Oh I’ve never seen it quite.  
Every Night I dive in with hope,  
To unveil the mystery the water holds.  
And Every Night it’s me who Sleeps,  
While the Ocean just sees me…\`

\`Then why do thy Sleep,  
What about the Enigma to unveil…\`

\`Because deep down it feels like a Dream,  
Whether it’s My Mind or The Ocean that might seem…  
Maybe thy know What I mean,  
To Sleep in the Space full of Him…\`
