## Blue flowers <a id="1947"></a>

I brought these flowers for you to feel,  
You tell me they’re blue when you see them,  
The feelings are lost like your sleep,  
In your icy heart, you tell me you can’t feel.

Then you walk on those rose petals,  
Lest we forget to hold hands,  
Then you vanish all of a sudden,  
Leaving me strangling in the end.
