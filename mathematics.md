Windy walk along with you,  
The fractals flying in awe since you,  
And my senses are entwining tonight,  
Like the spirals in your sunflower knight.

And every path that I walked,  
Imitates the pattern of my thoughts,  
The neurons that fire up inside me,  
Speaks the accent of the numeric world.

Complex are the fibers that frame you,  
Beheld is that Artist that discovers you,  
And charmed is the field that applies to you,  
With every essence and every bit of you.

The dimensions that are lost to my eyes,  
With you, they come alive,  
Your abstractness and discreetness,  
It is in what the observable universe thrives.
