# Dusk

You don’t know why, You’re coming off shy, In the midst of the woods, The seasons fly.

## Dusk <a id="e625"></a>

You don’t know why,  
You’re coming off shy,  
In the midst of the woods,  
The seasons fly.

You never danced,  
When the rays hit the sky,  
In your ocean world,  
You let it sink by.

In the count of the time,  
They hardly cried,  
When the moon hit the sky,  
The sunsets by.

And you wondered why,  
It never rained quite,  
In the heart full of love,  
The moment's dusk.
