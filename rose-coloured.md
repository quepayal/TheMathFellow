# Rose Coloured

Thought I can stay forever, With me whatsoever, In the sky with no texture, And gray in every definition.

## Rose Coloured <a id="51fa"></a>

Thought I can stay forever,  
With me whatsoever,  
In the sky with no texture,  
And gray in every definition.

Neither sway by the rose-colored sky,  
Nor wither like the fallen saffron,  
Just quiet in my own fractions,  
Which never adds up to the random attractions.

To dive in oneâ€™s eyes,  
Was never my intentions,  
Strange how it happened,  
I wonder at my indulgence in those out-of-the-blue questions.

Do I really want the sky without any texture,  
Can I live this gray life amongst stunning sensation,  
Remain artless in this ringed life,  
Imagining one of those Rose-colored lives.
