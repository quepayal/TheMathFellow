## Without you <a id="3b92"></a>

When these pages talk about you,  
You are probably nowhere to listen to them.  
When these piano keys strike to create a tune,  
You’re somewhere where sounds can’t reach.

When the sunshine falls on one of your cheeks,  
It’s probably a polaroid and not you.  
When the tears trickle down my eyes,  
I tell the stars to think about me and not you.

The wind blows in oblivion,  
The lightening is outrageous,  
And your laughter is infectious,  
In this strange obscure world.

It certainly hurts me more than it ever hurt you,  
And all that haunts me was the moment you left,  
And the ages, I will live without you.
