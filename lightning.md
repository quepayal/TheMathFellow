## Lightning <a id="c71a"></a>

My broken arms still strike your charms,  
And the string that sings the tunes that last,  
In the winter world with the starry nights,  
The mist so cold and the breath so wild,  
And I play your strings till the afterlife,  
In the world that’s ours and the music’s live,  
The fractals fly when I see your smile,  
The wind that rhymes and the sun that shines,  
You’re the cloudy night, and I’m your thunder strike.

Would you walk with me even if it means no light,  
And hold me close when I’m the lightning strike.
