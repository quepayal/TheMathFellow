# Oblivion

The sun's rays feel so alive like the aurora borealis in the Alaskan sky…

## Oblivion <a id="01ca"></a>

A bright day with rays of light so vigorous with life.  
Triangular mirror pieces scattered like the sparkle on the cross-way.  
Revealing a foreign portal into a mysterious world.  
Facing the perceivable world in different gradients.  
The faded maneuver encompassing the air we breathe.  
The sound unheard mysteriously prevailing in the atmosphere.  
Yet the sun rays feel so alive like the aurora borealis in the Alaskan sky.

But dead is my senses tonight like the cry I always hide.  
The crossway is so unusually quiet, in spite of the commotion so energized.  
Yet my mind feels so quiet, then what’s this strange chaos it hides.  
The eyelids close thyself, and strange perfume floods my senses.  
A subtle scene unveils before my eyes, it speaks of an ancient cosmic tale.

The tale of a Lost Princess, in the land of nothingness.  
Where thou don’t hear voices, only the wind whispers by.  
It brings with itself the scent of oasis.  
It says the oasis holds the core of chaos that thy desire to realize.  
The perplexed beauty thus takes a dive into the infinite depth of the oasis that night.  
The water glides her hair like its own herb, it glows of colors that are vibrantly surreal.  
Her eyelids refuse to open like bud still wants to cherish her sleep.  
Yet the turbulence pulls her deep.

In the dark depth of unknown lights, lies the chaotic beauty.  
The core so glamorous, with tiny stardust, that it gathers.  
Still, her thought is so empty, the mind still asleep, or awake in awkward silence.  
It’s vacant like colorless fractals, that hail on an icy land.  
Yet it’s so strikingly beautiful.

Know thy Princess Oblivion…
