## Me <a id="77c7"></a>

Every fall is like a broken dream,  
And I trip on them for your sparkling feel.  
Every night it feels like a lucid dream,  
And I can’t help thinking about the lies I see.

Every eve sky paints itself invisible to me,  
And I Cross my heart thinking I’ll be free.  
Every promise to me is your biggest feat,  
Because I believe them like you gonna keep.

Every part of me hates you endlessly,  
But I know the other loves you despite me.
