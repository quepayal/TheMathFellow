# Waters

Standing in the middle of the water, That is frozen to the bottom, But when I start to walk on, It starts breaking into the fractals.

## Waters <a id="7f8a"></a>

Standing in the middle of the water,  
That is frozen to the bottom,  
But when I start to walk on,  
It starts breaking into the fractals.

Frozen inside in daylight,  
The wind’s also airy tonight,  
Experience being swallowed,  
By your own dim light.

The sky is breaking in sagas,  
Ocean in the reflections,  
In once my airy world,  
Which suddenly turned into the waters.

Now I can’t swim to the bottom, in the wind that’s altering my directions.
