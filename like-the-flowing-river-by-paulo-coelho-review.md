## Like the Flowing River by Paulo Coelho — Review <a id="7253"></a>

> Be like the flowing river,  
> Silent in the night.  
> Be not afraid of the dark.  
> If there are stars in the sky, reflect them back.  
> If there are clouds in the sky,  
> Remember, clouds, like the river, are water,  
> So, gladly reflect them too,  
> In your own tranquil depths.  
> — _**Manuel Bandeira**_

**Paulo Coelho’s** brand new book, _Like the Flowing River,_ is a glimpse of the beauty and tranquillity around us. It’s an assortment of anecdotes, thoughts, reflections, and stories.

Reading this book was like swimming in the river of experience, where each story tells you about the little mysteries of life. Those amiable ripples sometimes resonate with your own situation, as if they reflect your own saga in front of your eyes. It’s both a beautiful and somewhat incomplete experience on its own. Sometimes Paulo leaves you there with the tingling fire in your heart while other times fill it with the aroma of zillion roses…

My favorite story was _The funny thing about Human Beings._

> ‘Our contradictoriness.
>
> We are in such a hurry to grow up, and then we long for our lost childhood.
>
> We make ourselves ill earning money, and then spend all our money on getting well again.
>
> We think so much about the future that we neglect the present, and thus experience neither the present nor the future.
>
> We live as if we were never going to die, and die as if we had never lived.’

Paulo’s work is a refreshing experience and unique in its own way. You’ll feel the tiny prayers enlightening you like you kindle the fire. I recommend this book to everyone who doubts why you shouldn’t be swimming in this beautiful flowing river of life…
