## Sand of time <a id="a5d8"></a>

Standing on the terrace with the rift in your soul,  
Are you trying to hide the voice,  
That you fear would surface above,  
The blank face and your expressions can’t say it enough.

And even though I walk right away,  
You don’t trust me at all,  
Tell me what your hiding,  
In the time when you feel it all.

Don’t think it surprises me,  
I knew it all along,  
The silver sand of your time running,  
Have some of mine in it as it flows…
