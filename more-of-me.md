# More of me

Black locks tied up in a knot oblivion of spacetime,

## More of me <a id="42fb"></a>

Black locks tied up in knot oblivion of spacetime,  
The silky blanket beneath my presence with rhythmic serenity,  
And the colossal window to the ocean, sun, and the cosmos,  
With its shining aurora, an eclipse just about to break,  
The magnificent presence of a deep blue ocean and tiny patches of brown land down below me.

And the occasional tilting of the scene, almost unnoticeable,  
Diving into an ethereal space and airy stardust,  
Above the clouds impenetrable, over the place where I can’t hear your voice,  
With my mind immersed in this planetary sight,  
My soul frees from your captivating lies.

With the universe renovating me,  
I feel more of myself than ever have I before…
