## At times <a id="da63"></a>

At times I dream under the sky with eyes wide opened,  
Like a fresh bud overwhelmed by its fragrance,  
I try to compute the stars above in constellations they’re tied forever.

Often I’ll sit with the lil’ puppy,  
And watch him eat the cookies I brought,  
When he’s done, I’ll brush my arms around and watch him sleep as time goes.

Some days I just stare at my lovely plant,  
As I water, I see it wave around,  
I think it’s happy and it likes me the way I like it.

Other times I’m just alone by my thoughts,  
And I smile at what they think,  
Sure they scare me at times, but still, dreams are mine.

It’s those moments with them of mine, that still keeps my thought about me just mine…
