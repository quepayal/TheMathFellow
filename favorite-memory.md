# Favorite memory

Whenever I rush to you to play with me, You filled your eyes with happiness, Only to poke my forehead and say ‘Maybe next time’.

## Favorite memory <a id="523f"></a>

Whenever I rushed to you to play with me,  
You filled your eyes with happiness,  
Only to poke my forehead and say ‘Maybe next time’.

Even though the world was fading in hatred,  
You showered all your love on me,  
Only to break me apart later.

At times you were empty, but you still filled me,  
And all I needed was you brother,  
Then why couldn’t you trust me?

And all these years I’ve spent in disbelief,  
That cold stare of yours from that dreadful night,  
Has never left me since.

Nights are getting darker and colder,  
And the silence haunts me,  
And every day it’s your same words that wake me.

Though my bereft of life self says— ‘I’ll avenge everyone and kill you!’  
But when I hurt myself and bleed, I can’t cry,  
For you’re not there to heal me.

So I walk on the path of shadows,  
Thinking one day you’ll come back and say, ‘It was a bad dream, Sasuke!’,  
Because deep down brother,  
**‘You’re still my favorite memory!’**
