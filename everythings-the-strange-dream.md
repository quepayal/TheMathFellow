## Everything’s the Strange Dream <a id="b744"></a>

Everything’s the Strange Dream,  
Like someday I’ll fade away like petals in your rose,  
Defying the gravity of your thoughts,  
Straight up the hill,  
In the hidden fog.

And often the cherry blossom that falls,  
Is lost in the aroma of its cause,  
Like I never really know it all.  
When the rain washes my tears,  
Everything I know is a Strange Dream for a reason I hear.

A reason I’ll always run after,  
Chase like an ocean thirsty for its water,  
And I never really look up at the sky,  
Knowingly there’s where the answers shower.  
What is it, if it’s not the Strangest Dream?

Where I chase for ray in the dark, When I’m the Light of the Greatest Realm…
