## Realm <a id="17fb"></a>

Your petals fall on my head,  
Amongst the essence of your astray self,  
Another day, another night,  
Flows like the breeze and the dust in my eyes.

Looking up at the affair in the sky,  
With the eyes, I’d never have,  
And the touch that left my city,  
For another world where I ain’t go yet.

I missed you or your music,  
It is still a mystery in the end,  
For one dies for love,  
Or in love, I never knew in the end.

To this day, I’m wondering,  
Did I ever exist in your realm?
