## A little thought about my Poem titled — Stardust <a id="92f9"></a>

I wrote this poem from the perspective of a Stardust that’s wandering in the Universe, that’s dark and strangely silent despite all the commotion caused by the explosion of stars and cosmic particles.

It so happens that it rides onto one of the traveling streams towards a nearby Blackhole. Its gravity is astonishingly strong, and so is the curiosity of the Stardust to find what lies in that infinite depth of darkness which light can also not penetrate…

So the Stardust bids goodbye to its fellow cosmic particles and jumps into the Blackhole.

It’s a bit scary and exciting. Space and time tangle in strange ways that are incomprehensible. All it sees is countless blurred parallel lines of light.

Then suddenly it sees a window. It seems like it’s springtime over there, Stardust has never seen one, so it jumps into that window.

Strangely he lands on the floor along with the fallen flowers. The wind happens to be blowing, and it carries it away like the ray of light that travels on the water surface.

Finally, it lands on something, and it lands on the hair of a girl that is very beautiful and soft, it almost feels like heaven…

The girl was gazing at the sky from where the Stardust came. She’s perplexed and mystified at the vastness and beauty of the Universe. She wishes if she could touch a tiny Stardust from there… To which Stardust smiles and says, I’m here only, Sweet Angel!
