Yesterday was Cristiano Ronaldo’s birthday. He’d posted something on Instagram and I was curious about it. I’ll write the exact wordings below —

> As I celebrate my 36th birthday and my 20th year as a professional footballer, I’m sorry that I can’t promise you 20 more years of this. But what I can promise you, is that as long as I keep going, you’ll never receive less than 100% from me!

It straight away stood out for me. I’d like to do the same. Of course, we can’t predict something there in the future with unforeseen circumstances. All we control is the present. It’s realistic to give your 100 percent today than to promise the infinite possibility of success tomorrow.
