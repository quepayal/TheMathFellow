### If someone you loved was killed in front of you, but someone created a copy of them that was perfect right down to the atomic level, would they be the same person, and would you love them just as much? <a id="84d0"></a>

Interesting question, isn’t it? This question springs up an important question that is — _What does that person mean to you?_

I recall one incident. I had a dog and was very much fond of him. Then one day, he left this world behind in a very tragic way. The coming days had been sorrowful, and I spent quite a lot of my time wishing he was still around. I hoped that maybe he could come around one morning when I turn back while running. I think my love for him as compassionate love, and this can be replaced. I saw this happen when we had three more small dogs. They were pretty lovely, and my compassionate love was again rejuvenated for them, and even though I sometimes remember my old dog, it doesn’t hurt as it did before. There’s one more thing to consider: I didn’t spend quite a lot of time with him.

The important question that now arises in my head is that why do we desire or love anything? Is our love for them irreplaceable?

In my life, I’ve seen much variety of love. Surprisingly some of them aren’t close to love. But is love a relative quantity? From selfless love to compassionate love to romantic love to selfish desire. What exactly is it?

When there’s selfless love involved, no matter the person you created is the replica of the person killed, the mere thought that the person being killed creates turbulence in the mind. But the presence of the replica eases the pain, and the mind strategizes to convert that love to compassionate love.

We remember a person by the memories we had together. Memories get compounded over time. The consciousness of the individual involved evolves. It absorbs the surrounding, the setting, the feelings, and everything. In a sense, consciousness is a product of time and the environment. And the time element is absent while creating the replica. We cannot transfer the memories of an individual from one to another like Ctrl + C, and Ctrl + V. Whatever we intake goes through the primary interface of our individual consciousness. The atomic implant is something of a mystery to me. If it happens then, thoughts and bodies will transcend time, and there’s no more you and me!

I think our ignorance gives replacement space to breathe. It’s well said — Ignorance is bliss. Had it been a machine, then the reference would never match, and our minds would reject the idea of the replica. But it’s a human mind very sophisticated and fine-tuned to that person, and some part of our consciousness would never forget what we lost.
