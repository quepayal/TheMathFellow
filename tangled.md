You fake the love to hide your scars, I fake my heart for a broken one. You said it’s real with the sparkling fear, The heart that’s mine…

## Tangled <a id="5695"></a>

You fake the love to hide your scars,  
I fake my heart for a broken one.  
You said it’s real with the sparkling fear,  
The heart that’s mine in your mind still alive.

The spring that sighs in the moonlight,  
The cloud that hides the dark knight.  
Become the shadow in the daylight,  
And you call this passion of yours infinitely mine?
