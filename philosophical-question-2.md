Imagine being on grassy land, where the wind is blowing slowly. A strange, beautiful smell in the air and light sun rays kissing your cheeks. Suddenly you hear the sound of the squirrel, and she’s playing with her mom. She’s tiny and can fit in your palms. She doesn’t yet know how to climb the trees and jump from one branch to another. You’re standing beneath the tree, and suddenly one bad move and she falls directly in your palms. The moment you touch her, you realize she’s so soft and innocent. She clutches your fingers with her hands, and you slowly cover her. Your heart and her heart are in sync now. You caress her, and she lets you care for her. You experience **Happiness!**

In this small thought experiment, what I wanted to emphasize was if you let yourself unite with the universe, then the universe will resonate with the aura that you’ve. Human beings are wired to have an aura of Kindness, and when united with the universe, we experience otherworldly happiness that touches our soul.

A person’s aura might be that of a curious particle. The wonder of discovering something relatively new is a fantastic feeling and brings happiness! Happiness is the feeling you experience when you look up at the vast sky and wonder what you are doing in space, traveling alone on a humungous rock. Once you realize that, you’ll know how small your problems are at the scale of the universe. We experience sadness, anxiety, and all sorts of bizarre feelings because we get too attached to everything around us. We feel we possess those things and people. When in reality, it’s just a simulation in which you and I came alone and would have to go alone. The liberation from materialistic things brings happiness.

But the question that arises is — How to find meaning after abandoning the sense of possessiveness. Well, that’s a philosophical question for another day!
