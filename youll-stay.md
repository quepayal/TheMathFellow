## You’ll stay <a id="8497"></a>

I see you passing by my silence,  
Wish you knew how much they’re praying for your presence.  
The water swimming and drowning in itself,  
Wish you knew how much they miss you.

The petals and leaves swaying in the wind,  
Wish you knew how much they miss your touch.  
Little squirrels eating their way out,  
Wish you knew how much they miss you when they turn around.

The mornings smell of distant past,  
When you collided while running in my arms.  
When I open the door to peek outside,  
They search you everywhere out in the wild.

That unfortunate time of that Friday,  
When you needed me and I was tied in the strange thread.  
The day you went away,  
I assure you our eyes will still stay remembering you and those better days.

Hope you’re fine in the wild or the greater outer space,  
The one heavens and soul like you stay.  
This pitch-black fondness of me will forever stay,  
And so will you, my sweet Dog in memories of the beautiful days.
