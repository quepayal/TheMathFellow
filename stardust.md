# Stardust

I eclipse into that portal, of chaos I know no beauty…

## Stardust <a id="53c8"></a>

Where the dark rules the beauty,  
The silence veils space.  
Where the cosmic particles rushes like the flux of zest,  
And the black hole imbibe the light and the time.  
I wonder what’ll happen if I fall into one,  
To give away one’s wanderlust to dance of time.  
The celestial stars blazes with enchantment,  
I see the cosmos bid adieu.

So I dive holding my little breath,  
Into what that holds the infinite depth.  
My sense of space and time is lost,  
All I see is countless lines of what I call parallel stripes.  
A window I see, of which the cherry’s blooming in the space,  
I eclipse into that portal, of chaos I know no beauty.  
Fallen like the autumn leaves, I lay on the floor quiet,  
The wind seems to be in the mood, gushes me onto a stream.  
So I fly on this strange place, like light shimmering in the water,  
Above and beyond I go flying, and I reach a crest to fall.

Flowered with heavenly locks,  
She gazes at the sky I came.  
“Oh Stardust, I wish I could touch you”- she says,  
“Hey Payal, I’m here”- I say…
