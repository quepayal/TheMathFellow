_Your lie in April, known as_ _**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso**_ is a wonderful anime series written and illustrated by Naoshi Arakawa, one of my favorites, I’ll say! It’s a nice, musical, romantic love story. This anime has this meaningful aroma about it. And honestly, you can’t go through it with a cold heart.

The story starts with **Arima Kousei**, a piano prodigy who’d relentlessly mastered the state of the art of playing the piano. But all of a sudden he quits playing, he says he can’t hear the sound of the piano, that they had turned monotonous just like his life…

The truth was he had blamed himself for his mother’s demise. **Saki**, Arima’s mother, has some life-threatening disease, and she had to do justice to her heir, so she opted for the cold way to teach her son how to play the piano perfectly, but being a perfectionist, Arima’s simply doing well in the competition wasn’t enough to please her. She continued pushing her son till the point when he couldn’t take it, and in frustration, he said, “I won’t care even if you die…”

That same day she takes her last breath. Though she really cares for him, it’s only but natural for a mother to worry about her son’s source of living… Isn’t it obvious?? We often misunderstand our parents, but the same goes for them also…

For Arima, it’s like a Death sentence to his musical career and himself. The music he could feel resonating inside him is all of a sudden so empty… He’ll start to play passionately, but then all of a sudden, there’s this huge gush of water, and it deafens him. It’s like he’s trying to scream, but no one can hear. He can’t hear himself. He thinks it’s all his fault his mother died, and this is his punishment…

> **But one day he met the girl under the full bloomed cherry blossoms and his fate began to change.**

I always wonder, in this world full of so many people, how do we meet someone. Isn’t it special? Is it by chance? I believe some people are meant to cross their ways, they may not stay for too long, but their memories cherish forever. I don’t know, but…

> **Sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck…**

Those people are wonderful, aren’t they? When you think you're irreparable, _Universe_ has this mysterious way of bumping you into them… Those are the people who inspire you for good. You can’t forget them. You can only _love._

**Kaori Miyazono** is that person in Arima’s life.

I’ll not be doing justice if I go on telling you what happened next… It’s worth watching. I can’t put them in words…

And yeah, you guys might be wondering what’s the _**lie**_ about… Well, it’s a mystery, a beautiful one!

Thanks for reading…
